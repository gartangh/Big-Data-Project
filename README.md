# LET'S TWEET CORONA #
Corona Deniers are everywhere.
A few weeks ago, I was walking in a nearby department store. Here, I noticed a woman arguing with the shopkeeper.
She stated several times corona does not even exist and that governments are just experimenting with new methods to keep us at home.

We call her a *Corona Denier*.

Who are they? And where do they live?
All over the world, fake news is spreading regarding corona attacking corona believers, virologists and even China.
If we can identify where these tweets come from, we can:
1. Flag and remove the fake accounts.
2. Make people faster aware of the problems with global disasters.
3. Prevent situations like the one in the shop from happening again.

# Project Status #
This project is an easy-to-use Python API that addresses aforementioned prolems in the following way:
- We were able to create and train a machine learning model with 98% accuracy that identifies whether or not a tweet stems from a corona denier or a corona believer.
- We are able to visualize what continents and countries have more deniers.

# Future Goals #
Our next step would be to zoom in cities and neighbourhoods to identify hotspots around the globe.
